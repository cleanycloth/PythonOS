# PythonOS
A quick and dirty operating system lookalike program made in Python, originally as a joke between myself and a friend in college a couple of years ago.

Prerequisites:
Some form of Python 3, but I'd recommend the latest.

VLC is optional, but the program will report sound playback issues at startup.

Make sure you install the VLC version appropriate for your architecture (32bit VLC on 64bit Windows will not work for some reason).

For Linux, nano is required for the text editor, because I detest Vim. Sorry. And since macOS has it by default it makes things easier.

Windows has been tested for compatibility, but it *should* work on Linux and macOS as well. Though, it's been a while since I last tested it.

This program uses some external programs and code:

VLC loader program by the VideoLan Project: https://wiki.videolan.org/PythonBinding

Kinesics Text Editor by the Joe Lowe Project: http://turtlewar.org/projects/editor/


Changelog:

Unfortunately, I didn't think to write a changelog for anything below 1.7f of the program, so we'll start from there.

1.7f:
Uploaded to GitHub, finally. Removed some unnecessary files from the upload and reset the program for first use.
